	 * unreachable objects into a single file.

	 * If an UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE pack is already larger than this limit it will
	 * be left alone by the garbage collector. This avoids unnecessary disk IO
	 * reading and copying the objects.

	 * If limit is set to {@link Long#MAX_VALUE}, everything is coalesced.
	 * <p>
	 * Keeping unreachable garbage prevents race conditions with repository
	 * changes that may suddenly need an object whose only copy was stored in
	 * the UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE pack.
