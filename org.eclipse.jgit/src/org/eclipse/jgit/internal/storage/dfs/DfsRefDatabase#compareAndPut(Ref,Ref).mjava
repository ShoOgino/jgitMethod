	 * <li>If one reference is a symbolic ref, the other one should be a symbolic
	 * ref.
	 * <li>If both are symbolic refs, the target names should be same.

	 *            exist the old value has a storage of
	 *            {@link org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Ref.Storage#NEW} and an ObjectId
	 *            value of {@code null}.
	 * @param newRef
	 *            new reference to store.
	 * @return true if the put was successful; false otherwise.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             the reference cannot be put due to a system error.
