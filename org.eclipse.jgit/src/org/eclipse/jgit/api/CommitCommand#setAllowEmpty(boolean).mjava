	 *            When this flag is set to false an attempt to create an "empty"
	 *            standard commit will lead to an EmptyCommitException.

	 *            By default when creating a commit containing only specified
	 *            paths an attempt to create an empty commit leads to a

	 *            <code>true</code> this exception will not be thrown.
