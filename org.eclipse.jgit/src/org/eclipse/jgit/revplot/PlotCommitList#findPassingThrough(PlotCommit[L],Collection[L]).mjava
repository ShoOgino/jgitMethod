	/**
	 * Find the set of lanes passing through a commit's row.
	 * <p>
	 * Lanes passing through a commit are lanes that the commit is not directly
	 * on, but that need to travel through this commit to connect a descendant
	 * (child) commit to an ancestor (parent) commit. Typically these lanes will
	 * be drawn as lines in the passed commit's box, and the passed commit won't
	 * appear to be connected to those lines.
	 * <p>
	 * This method modifies the passed collection by adding the lanes in any
	 * order.
	 *
	 * @param currCommit
	 *            the commit the caller needs to get the lanes from.
	 * @param result
	 *            collection to add the passing lanes into.
