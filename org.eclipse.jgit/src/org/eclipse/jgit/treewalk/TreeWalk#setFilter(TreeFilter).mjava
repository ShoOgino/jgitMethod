	 * filter implementations may also be constructed by applications.

	 * TreeWalk instances. Every TreeWalk must be supplied its own unique
	 * filter, unless the filter implementation specifically states it is (and
	 * always will be) thread-safe. Callers may use {@link TreeFilter#clone()}
	 * to create a unique filter tree for this TreeWalk instance.

	 * @param newFilter
	 *            the new filter. If null the special {@link TreeFilter#ALL}
	 *            filter will be used instead, as it matches every entry.
