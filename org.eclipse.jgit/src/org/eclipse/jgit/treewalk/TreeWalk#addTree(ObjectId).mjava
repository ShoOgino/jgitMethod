	 * @throws IncorrectObjectTypeException
	 *             the given object id does not denote a tree, but instead names
	 *             some other non-tree type of object. Note that commits are not
	 *             trees, even if they are sometimes called a "tree-ish".
	 * @throws CorruptObjectException
	 *             the object claimed to be a tree, but its contents did not
	 *             appear to be a tree. The repository may have data corruption.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             a loose object or pack file could not be read.
