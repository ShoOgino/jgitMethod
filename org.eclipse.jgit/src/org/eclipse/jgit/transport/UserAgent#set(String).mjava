	 * <p>
	 * Spaces and other whitespace should be avoided as these will be
	 * automatically converted to {@code "."}.
	 * <p>
	 * User agent strings are restricted to printable ASCII.

	 * @param agent
	 *            new user agent string for this running JGit library. Setting
	 *            to null or empty string will avoid sending any identification
	 *            to the peer.
