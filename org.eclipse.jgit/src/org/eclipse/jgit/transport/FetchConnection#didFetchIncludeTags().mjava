	 * Did the last {@link #fetch(ProgressMonitor, Collection, Set)} get tags?
	 * <p>
	 * Some Git aware transports are able to implicitly grab an annotated tag if
	 * {@link TagOpt#AUTO_FOLLOW} or {@link TagOpt#FETCH_TAGS} was selected and
	 * the object the tag peels to (references) was transferred as part of the
	 * last {@link #fetch(ProgressMonitor, Collection, Set)} call. If it is
	 * possible for such tags to have been included in the transfer this method
	 * returns true, allowing the caller to attempt tag discovery.
	 * <p>
	 * By returning only true/false (and not the actual list of tags obtained)
	 * the transport itself does not need to be aware of whether or not tags
	 * were included in the transfer.
	 *
	 * @return true if the last fetch call implicitly included tag objects;
	 *         false if tags were not implicitly obtained.
