	 * within {@code local.getConfig()} using the remote block named by the
	 * {@code remoteName}, if the name is non-null.

	 *            repository.
	 * @param uri
	 *            address of the Git repository.
	 * @param remoteName
	 *            name of the remote, if the remote as configured in

	 * @return the transport.
	 * @throws NotSupportedException
