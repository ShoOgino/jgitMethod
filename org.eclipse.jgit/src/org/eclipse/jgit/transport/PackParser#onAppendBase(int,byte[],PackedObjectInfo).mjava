	 * Provide the implementation with a base that was outside of the pack.

	 * This event only occurs on a thin pack for base objects that were outside

	 * uses this event to compress the base and append it onto the end of the
	 * pack, so the pack stays self-contained.
	 *
	 * @param typeCode
	 *            type of the base object.
	 * @param data
	 *            complete content of the base object.
	 * @param info
	 *            packed object information for this base. Implementors must
	 *            populate the CRC and offset members if returning true.
	 * @return true if the {@code info} should be included in the object list
	 *         returned by {@link #getSortedObjectList(Comparator)}, false if it
	 *         should not be included.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             the base could not be included into the pack.
