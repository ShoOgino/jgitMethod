	 * graph?
	 * <p>
	 * Some transports walk the object graph on the client side, with the client
	 * looking for what objects it is missing and requesting them individually
	 * from the remote peer. By virtue of completing the fetch call the client
	 * implicitly tested the object connectivity, as every object in the graph
	 * was either already local or was requested successfully from the peer. In
	 * such transports this method returns true.
	 * <p>
	 * Some transports assume the remote peer knows the Git object graph and is
	 * able to supply a fully connected graph to the client (although it may
	 * only be transferring the parts the client does not yet have). Its faster
	 * to assume such remote peers are well behaved and send the correct
	 * response to the client. In such transports this method returns false.
	 *
	 * @return true if the last fetch had to perform a connectivity check on the
	 *         client side in order to succeed; false if the last fetch assumed
	 *         the remote peer supplied a complete graph.
