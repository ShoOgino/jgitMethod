	/**
	 * Commit a pack and index pair that was written to the DFS.
	 * <p>
	 * Committing the pack/index pair makes them visible to readers. The JGit
	 * DFS code always writes the pack, then the index. This allows a simple
	 * commit process to do nothing if readers always look for both files to
	 * exist and the DFS performs atomic creation of the file (e.g. stream to a
	 * temporary file and rename to target on close).
	 * <p>
	 * During pack compaction or GC the new pack file may be replacing other
	 * older files. Implementations should remove those older files (if any) as
	 * part of the commit of the new file.
	 *
	 * @param desc
	 *            description of the new packs.
	 * @param replaces
	 *            if not null, list of packs to remove.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             the packs cannot be committed. On failure a rollback must
	 *             also be attempted by the caller.
