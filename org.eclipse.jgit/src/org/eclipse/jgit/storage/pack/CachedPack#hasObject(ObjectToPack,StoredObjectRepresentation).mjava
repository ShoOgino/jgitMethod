	 * Implementors are strongly encouraged to rely on looking at {@code rep}

	 * pack. Implementors should ensure a representation from this cached pack
	 * is tested as part of
	 * {@link ObjectReuseAsIs#selectObjectRepresentation(PackWriter, org.eclipse.jgit.lib.ProgressMonitor, Iterable)}
	 * , ensuring this method would eventually return true if the object would
	 * be included by this cached pack.

	 * @param rep

	 *            originally supplied this CachedPack.
	 * @return true if this pack contains this object.
