	 * Prepare the list of objects to be written to the pack stream.
	 * <p>
	 * Basing on these 2 sets, another set of objects to put in a pack file is
	 * created: this set consists of all objects reachable (ancestors) from
	 * interesting objects, except uninteresting objects and their ancestors.
	 * This method uses class {@link ObjectWalk} extensively to find out that
	 * appropriate set of output objects and their optimal order in output pack.
	 * Order is consistent with general git in-pack rules: sort by object type,
	 * recency, path and delta-base first.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param countingMonitor
	 *            progress during object enumeration.
	 * @param want
	 *            collection of objects to be marked as interesting (start
	 *            points of graph traversal).
	 * @param have
	 *            collection of objects to be marked as uninteresting (end
	 *            points of graph traversal).
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             when some I/O problem occur during reading objects.
	 * @deprecated to be removed in 2.0; use the Set version of this method.
