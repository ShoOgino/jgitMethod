	 * (only if reuseDeltas or reuseObjects is enabled) and
	 * {@link #WRITING_OBJECTS_PROGRESS} are updated during packing.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * All reused objects data checksum (Adler32/CRC32) is computed and
	 * validated against existing checksum.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param compressMonitor
	 *            progress monitor to report object compression work.
	 * @param writeMonitor
	 *            progress monitor to report the number of objects written.
	 * @param packStream
	 *            output stream of pack data. The stream should be buffered by
	 *            the caller. The caller is responsible for closing the stream.
	 * @throws IOException
