	 * Parse the committer identity from the raw buffer.
	 * <p>
	 * This method parses and returns the content of the committer line, after
	 * taking the commit's character set into account and decoding the committer
	 * name and email address. This method is fairly expensive and produces a
	 * new PersonIdent instance on each invocation. Callers should invoke this
	 * method only if they are certain they will be outputting the result, and
	 * should cache the return value for as long as necessary to use all
	 * information from it.
	 * <p>
	 * RevFilter implementations should try to use {@link RawParseUtils} to scan
	 * the {@link #getRawBuffer()} instead, as this will allow faster evaluation
	 * of commits.
	 * 
	 * @return identity of the committer (name, email) and the time the commit
	 *         was made by the committer; null if no committer line was found.
