	 *             invocation to {@link #lookupCommit(AnyObjectId)}.
	 * @throws IncorrectObjectTypeException

	 *             parsing that it is not actually a commit. This usually
	 *             indicates the caller supplied a non-commit SHA-1 to
	 *             {@link #lookupCommit(AnyObjectId)}.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             a pack file or loose object could not be read.
