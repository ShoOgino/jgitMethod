	 * describe the boolean expression required by the application. Custom
	 * filter implementations may also be constructed by applications.
	 * <p>

	 * RevWalk instances. Every RevWalk must be supplied its own unique filter,
	 * unless the filter implementation specifically states it is (and always
	 * will be) thread-safe. Callers may use {@link RevFilter#clone()} to create
	 * a unique filter tree for this RevWalk instance.
	 *
	 * @param newFilter
	 *            the new filter. If null the special {@link RevFilter#ALL}
	 *            filter will be used instead, as it matches every commit.
