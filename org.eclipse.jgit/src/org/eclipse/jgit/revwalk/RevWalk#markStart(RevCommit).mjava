	/**
	 * Mark a commit to start graph traversal from.
	 * <p>
	 * Callers are encouraged to use {@link #parseCommit(AnyObjectId)} to obtain
	 * the commit reference, rather than {@link #lookupCommit(AnyObjectId)}, as
	 * this method requires the commit to be parsed before it can be added as a
	 * root for the traversal.
	 * <p>
	 * The method will automatically parse an unparsed commit, but error
	 * handling may be more difficult for the application to explain why a
	 * RevCommit is not actually a commit. The object pool of this walker would
	 * also be 'poisoned' by the non-commit RevCommit.
	 * 
	 * @param c
	 *            the commit to start traversing from. The commit passed must be
	 *            from this same revision walker.
	 * @throws MissingObjectException
	 *             the commit supplied is not available from the object
	 *             database. This usually indicates the supplied commit is
	 *             invalid, but the reference was constructed during an earlier
	 *             invocation to {@link #lookupCommit(AnyObjectId)}.
	 * @throws IncorrectObjectTypeException
	 *             the object was not parsed yet and it was discovered during
	 *             parsing that it is not actually a commit. This usually
	 *             indicates the caller supplied a non-commit SHA-1 to
	 *             {@link #lookupCommit(AnyObjectId)}.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             a pack file or loose object could not be read.
