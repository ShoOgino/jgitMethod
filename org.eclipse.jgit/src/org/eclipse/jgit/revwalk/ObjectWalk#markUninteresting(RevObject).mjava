	/**
	 * Mark an object to not produce in the output.
	 * <p>
	 * Uninteresting objects denote not just themselves but also their entire
	 * reachable chain, back until the merge base of an uninteresting commit and
	 * an otherwise interesting commit.
	 * <p>
	 * Callers are encouraged to use {@link RevWalk#parseAny(AnyObjectId)}
	 * instead of {@link RevWalk#lookupAny(AnyObjectId, int)}, as this method
	 * requires the object to be parsed before it can be added as a root for the
	 * traversal.
	 * <p>
	 * The method will automatically parse an unparsed object, but error
	 * handling may be more difficult for the application to explain why a
	 * RevObject is not actually valid. The object pool of this walker would
	 * also be 'poisoned' by the invalid RevObject.
	 * <p>
	 * This method will automatically call {@link RevWalk#markStart(RevCommit)}
	 * if passed RevCommit instance, or a RevTag that directly (or indirectly)
	 * references a RevCommit.
	 *
	 * @param o
	 *            the object to start traversing from. The object passed must be
	 * @throws MissingObjectException
	 *             the object supplied is not available from the object
	 *             database. This usually indicates the supplied object is
	 *             invalid, but the reference was constructed during an earlier
	 *             invocation to {@link RevWalk#lookupAny(AnyObjectId, int)}.
	 * @throws IncorrectObjectTypeException
	 *             the object was not parsed yet and it was discovered during
	 *             parsing that it is not actually the type of the instance
	 *             passed in. This usually indicates the caller used the wrong
	 *             type in a {@link RevWalk#lookupAny(AnyObjectId, int)} call.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             a pack file or loose object could not be read.
