	/**
	 * Parse a commit from its canonical format.
	 *
	 * This method constructs a temporary revision pool, parses the commit as
	 * supplied, and returns it to the caller. Since the commit was built inside
	 * of a private revision pool its parent pointers will be initialized, but
	 * will not have their headers loaded.
	 *
	 * Applications are discouraged from using this API. Callers usually need
	 * more than one commit. Use {@link RevWalk#parseCommit(AnyObjectId)} to
	 * obtain a RevCommit from an existing repository.
	 *
	 * @param raw
	 *            the canonical formatted commit to be parsed.
	 * @return the parsed commit, in an isolated revision pool that is not
	 *         available to the caller.
