	/**
	 * Obtain a reference to the (possibly cached) bytes of this object.
	 *
	 * If the object size is less than or equal to {@code sizeLimit} this method
	 * will provide it as a byte array, even if {@link #isLarge()} is true. This
	 * utility is useful for application code that absolutely must have the
	 * object as a single contiguous byte array in memory.
	 *
	 * This method offers direct access to the internal caches, potentially
	 * saving on data copies between the internal cache and higher level code.
	 * Callers who receive this reference <b>must not</b> modify its contents.
	 * Changes (if made) will affect the cache but not the repository itself.
	 *
	 * @param sizeLimit
	 *            maximum number of bytes to return. If the object size is
	 *            larger than this limit and {@link #isLarge()} is true,
	 *            {@link LargeObjectException} will be thrown.
	 * @return the cached bytes of this object. Do not modify it.
	 * @throws LargeObjectException
	 *             if the object is bigger than {@code sizeLimit}, or if
	 *             {@link OutOfMemoryError} occurs during allocation of the
	 *             result array. Callers should use {@link #openStream()}
	 *             instead to access the contents.
	 * @throws MissingObjectException
	 *             the object is large, and it no longer exists.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             the object store cannot be accessed.
