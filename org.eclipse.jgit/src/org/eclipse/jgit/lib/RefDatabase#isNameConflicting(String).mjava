	 * If the reference "refs/heads/foo" exists then "refs/heads/foo/bar" must
	 * not exist, as a reference cannot have a value and also be a container for
	 * other references at the same time.

	 * If the reference "refs/heads/foo/bar" exists than the reference
	 * "refs/heads/foo" cannot exist, for the same reason.
	 *
	 * @param name

	 * @return true if the name overlaps with an existing reference; false if
	 *         using this name right now would be safe.
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             the database could not be read to check for conflicts.
