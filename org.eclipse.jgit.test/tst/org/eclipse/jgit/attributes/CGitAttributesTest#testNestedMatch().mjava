		// gitignore documentation says: "In other words, foo/ will match a
		// directory foo AND PATHS UNDERNEATH IT, but will not match a regular
		// file or a symbolic link foo". (Emphasis added.) And gitattributes is
		// supposed to follow the same rules. But the documentation appears to
		// lie: C-git will *not* apply the attribute "xml" to *any* files in
		// any subfolder "foo" here. It will only apply the "jar" attribute
		// to the three *.jar files.
		//
		// The point is probably that ignores are handled top-down, and once a
		// directory "foo" is matched (here: on paths "foo" and "sub/foo" by
		// pattern "foo/"), the directory is excluded and the gitignore
		// documentation also says: "It is not possible to re-include a file if
		// a parent directory of that file is excluded." So once the pattern
		// "foo/" has matched, it appears as if everything beneath would also be
		// matched.
		//
		// But not so for gitattributes! The foo/ rule only matches the
		// directory itself, but not anything beneath.
